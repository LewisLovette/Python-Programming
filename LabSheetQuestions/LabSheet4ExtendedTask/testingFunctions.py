#Use the function to gather share data from the London Stock Exchange for three of the biggest UK
#supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsburys and Morrisons. Write you own code to compare the stock price levels and
#volatility (e.g. different averages, standard deviation) and compare with the results of commands from the
#statistics package. Use the third party package matplotlib (installed in Codio) to plot the data.
#The fourth big supermarket in the UK, Asda, is not listed as it is owned by US company Wal-Mart. You
#could try to find stock data for Wal-Mart from another of Quandlâ€™s databases.
