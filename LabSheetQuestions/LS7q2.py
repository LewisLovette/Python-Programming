#An anagram of a word is another word formed from the same letters. For example, parse and spare are
#anagrams. Create a dictionary where the keys are tuples of letters and the values anagrams they create.
#Hints: you can extract the letters from a string by converting to a list and there is a list method to put
#them into alphabetical order! In Scrabble a player receives a bonus if they create an 8 letter word. Use
#your dictionary to find out which group of 8 letters can create the most words.
